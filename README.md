# Todo List 
We start the adventure with a simple list of tasks which we are going to develop with JavaScript technologies, we will use NodeJs for the backend and MongoDB as a database.

We carry out the basic operations of a CRUD:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

We will carry out practices that have been learned so far, over time we will debug the code and make it more readable.
